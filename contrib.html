<h1>Project Contribution Guidelines</h1>

<p>
The goal of the rump kernel project is to offer free, re-usable,
kernel-quality drivers.  Additionally, we offer products built on top
of those drivers, such as the Rumprun unikernel.
</p>

<p>
The emphasis of development is on a well-architected and modular
infrastructure providing the maximal amount of features with the minimal
amount of code.  As a rule of thumb, we do not write, port or maintain
code that we can use unmodified and readily tested from other sources.
</p>


<h2>Contributions</h2>

<p>
A contribution to the rump kernel project is defined as a change
which makes an observable improvement to a repository hosted under
<a href="https://github.com/rumpkernel/">github.com/rumpkernel</a>.
Contributions include, but are not limited to,
documentation and code.  All code contributions should be covered by a
2-clause BSD license.  In exceptional circumstances we will also accept
a BSD-like license, e.g. when a key part of a contribution consists of
code from a third party.  Contributions shall be free of all legal
encumberment such as, but not limited to, software patents.  If you are
not the owner of the contribution, e.g. in case working for a company,
you must have appropriate authorization.  Copyright remains with the
contributors.
</p>

<p>
Contributions are divided roughly into two groups: ones needing public
review and ones not needing it.  Large, architectural and
controversial changes need public review.  Simple and "obviously correct"
changes to not need it.  It is not possible to precisely define the
subjective term "obviously", so when in doubt, it is better to err on
the side of too much review.  You can find the review process detailed
below in the section <a href="#reviewprocess">Review process</a>.
</p>

<p>
When the appropriate review has been undertaken, if you have push
access to the repository you are contributing to, you can push your
change. Otherwise, submit a pull request to the appropriate repository.
We do not require {Approved,Reviewed,etc}-by tags in the commits.
</p>

<p>
We encourage contributions in the size of minimal self-contained
functional units.  For example, if bug fixes are made while working on
a larger feature, it is best to submit the bug fixes independently --
trivial bug fixes do not need review.  Also, if independently useful
functionality is developed as part of a larger change, contributing that
functionality as an individual change is encouraged.
</p>

<h2>Review process</h2>

<p>
Review happens by sending a patch to the appropriate mailing list
(currently always <a href="mailto:rumpkernel-users@freelists.org">rumpkernel-users@freelists.org</a>)
with a descriptive
subject.  We prefer a single patch and mail for a single contribution
instead of a series of mails and patches (nb. you can still issue the
pull request as a series of commits).  Include a few lines of background
information on your contribution so that people not intimately familiar
with the area of your patch can still understand how the patch fits into
the rump kernel ecosystem.
</p>

<h2>Bugs reports</h2>

<p>
Submit bug reports as issues to the appropriate repositories.  If you
have a proposed fix, follow the contribution procedure as described above.
A proposed fix is never required for submitting a bug report. If you are
working on a fix, but it will take some time, submit the bug report and
note that you are working on a fix.  We would rather have the majority
of our bugs be publicly known bugs instead of unknown bugs.
